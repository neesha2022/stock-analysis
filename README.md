##Stock-analysis**
##**Overview of Project: Explain the purpose of this analysis**

When we started this project, we worked our way by coding for specific requirements and started implementing individually by coding for calculating the total daily volume, the return on stocks in DQ analysis and use conditional highlighting. We learned to write code by using variables, creating loops, writing if-then statements, etc. 

##**Results:**
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

##**Summary**: In a summary statement, address the following questions

##**1. What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**

##**Advantages**:
When we write a code, we might end up writing some duplicate code, it might not be restructured and can have longer methods and too many parameters. 
The benefit of Code refactoring is that we make tiny changes in the source code without impacting its application. The main idea is to simplify an over-complicated code to more efficient, simpler, cleaner, and easier to understand. It also helps developers to find the hidden bugs and vulnerabilities in the system. 
Code Refactoring is an important exercise to remove code smell. It helps to find bugs, makes programs run faster, it's easier to understand the code, improves the design of software, etc. Code smell slows down the development and is prone to more defects. An adequate set of unit tests and a supportive environment should be there for code refactoring.

##**Disadvantages**:
Code refactoring can be time consuming. We may have no idea how much time it may take to complete the process. It may also land you into a situation where you have no idea where to go.
We also need to make sure that tests need to be maintained because whenever requirements change, you would like to vary the code and tests. This suggests that you simply got to change the tests first then make the tests pass. So, actually, this disadvantage is that the same as before when writing code that apparently takes an extended time.

##**How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?**
Pros: The runtime decreased after refactoring the code. 
Cons: After refactoring, it increased the runtime and it took a considerable amount of time to figure out the mistake. Also testing needs to be done whether refactoring has improved the efficiency or not.
